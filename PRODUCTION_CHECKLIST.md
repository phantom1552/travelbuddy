## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Application Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs api

# Verify environment variables
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config

# Check port availability
netstat -tlnp | grep :8000
```

#### High Memory Usage
```bash
# Monitor container resources
docker stats

# Check for memory leaks
docker exec -it ai-trip-checklist-api ps aux

# Restart if necessary
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart api
```

#### API Errors
```bash
# Check Groq API connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY" https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models

# Verify rate limits
grep "rate limit" logs/app.log

# Check authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/test
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Stop current deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# Rollback to previous version
./scripts/deploy.sh rollback

# Verify rollback success
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

#### Service Recovery
```bash
# Check system resources
free -h
df -h
top

# Restart services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart

# Clear logs if disk full
find logs/ -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -delete
```
